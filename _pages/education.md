    title: "ECE 3340 - Numerical Methods for Electrical Engineers"
    excerpt: "This course is an introduction to numerical analysis with an emphasis on practical applications, implementation, and algorithm design. The primary objective is to provide an understanding of the algorithms and pitfalls encountered when performing numerical operations on computational systems. We will cover algorithm design and analysis, including methods for numerically solving nonlinear equations, linear systems, and partial differential equations."

    title: "ECE 6340 - Parallel and Heterogeneous Computing"
    excerpt: "This course focuses on the design and development of algorithms that take advantage of highly parallel co-processors to solve large numerical problems. This includes an overview of data-parallel architectures and principles in programming massively parallel systems. The course requires a good understanding of C/C++ and students will implement algorithms using multi-threading (ex. std::thread and pthreads), OpenMP, and GPU computing with CUDA."
